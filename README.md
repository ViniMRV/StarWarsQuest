It's a small API based on Star Wars that you can create quests, characters, ships and planets and make characters and spaceships assignments to quests.<br>
The API has a connection with SWAPI, so the user can get characters and spaceships directly from the SWAPI to add it into the local database.<br>
I made this project to pratice clean architecture and mediator patterns on .NET 8
